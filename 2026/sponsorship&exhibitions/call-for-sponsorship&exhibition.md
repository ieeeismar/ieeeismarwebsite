## What is ISMAR?
IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) is a flagship conference (CORE 2021 A* rating) that explores the advances in research and commercial activities related to AR, MR, and Virtual Reality (VR). ISMAR is setting new standards and trends with wide-ranging, creative, innovative, and highly technical content (see example 2025 program at <a href="https://www.ieeeismar.net/2025/program/overview/">ISMAR 2025 Program Overview</a>)

## Where is ISMAR?
<a href="https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/">ISMAR 2026</a> will be hosted in Bari, Italy, from 9 to 16 October 2026. Located on the Adriatic coast, Bari combines a dynamic innovation landscape with a highly appealing Mediterranean setting. Its modern venues, strong university presence, and easy international connections make it an ideal place for tech companies to showcase their capabilities at IEEE ISMAR.

## Who attends ISMAR?
Worldwide academic leaders, Ph.D. and students from world-class technical universities, budding entrepreneurs looking to partner in new ventures, and established industry leaders in AR/MR/VR hardware/software technologies and solutions are attending. ISMAR promotes diversity and inclusion, and the community has been growing over the years. In 2025, we had a record attendance with around 800 registrations from around the world.
