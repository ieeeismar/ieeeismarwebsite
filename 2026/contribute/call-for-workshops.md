The IEEE ISMAR 2026 organizing committee invites proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the ISMAR conference. The workshops will be scheduled on October 5th (Monday) and October 6th (Tuesday) and can be conducted in person, online, or in hybrid mode, in alignment with the ISMAR conference.

ISMAR workshops provide a platform for presenting novel work, work in progress, and position papers. The workshops bring together researchers, developers, technology providers, practitioners, and users for an in-depth and interactive discussion of important/emerging issues in augmented, mixed, and virtual reality through an informal yet thought-provoking exchange of ideas and information. We encourage workshops that go beyond the “mini-conferences” format of organization and promote interactive discussions among presenters and participants.
The workshops may target a specific application area, research area, or topic of general interest to the ISMAR community. The scope of the workshop should align with the <a href=" https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/call-for-papers/#topics-of-interest">ISMAR 2026 Topics of Interest.</a>

We envision the workshops as launch pads to propel the ISMAR community forward in specific research directions, to build a sub-community around shared research interests, and to bridge ISMAR with other research communities.

Workshop proposals must be submitted before May 22nd, 2026 (23:59 AoE, Friday). The committee will review the workshop proposals and notify the organizing team of acceptance by June 5th, 2026.

## Important Dates

- Workshop proposal deadline: **May 22nd, 2026 (23:59 AoE, Friday)**
- Workshop acceptance notification: **June 5th, 2026 (Friday)**
- Workshop calls for participation issued by: **June 19th, 2026 (Friday)**
- Workshop acceptance notification to participants issued by: **July 17th, 2026 (Friday)**
- Camera-ready materials: **July 31st, 2026 (Friday)**


ISMAR workshops may be organized in different formats. We encourage a format that involves interactions and discussions beyond a “mini-conference” format (i.e., a series of paper presentations followed by Q&A).  The workshop, for example, can be organized in a seminar style, where attendees are invited to participate in the discussion of the papers in the workshop actively.  Organizers may include, for example, break-out sessions, hands-on sessions, curated panels, or pro-contra discussions of reading lists. Workshops may also be organized as a combination of multiple formats. <strong>The organizers should clearly explain the proposed format of their workshop in the proposal.</strong>

## Pubblication Options 

Workshop organizers can choose one of two options regarding publication: (1) The workshop’s papers will be published in ISMAR 2026 Adjunct proceedings and IEEE Xplore (accepted papers should be formatted using the  <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/" target="_blank"> IEEE Computer Society VGTC conference format</a> and will be subject to the registration and publication processing policy of ISMAR 2026), or (2) The workshop’s papers will not be published but will be distributed as supplemental material along with the ISMAR 2026 proceedings, as a part of the conference material.

## Submission Guidelines for Workshop Proposals

A template for workshop proposals is available [(here .docx)](/2026/files/ISMAR_2026_Workshops_Proposal_Template.docx), [(here .pdf)](/2026/files/ISMAR_2026_Workshops_Proposal_Template.pdf)



Organizers (a minimum of two organizers per workshop) are expected to be proactive in the field where they propose a workshop. Potential workshop organizers should also note that at least one workshop organizer is required to attend the workshop they proposed, either in person or online, depending on the workshop format. Any change to the workshop organization team must be submitted in writing at least two weeks before the workshop paper deadline. No changes to the workshop organization team can be made after this date to ensure that potential participants submitting papers to workshops are aware of the final organization team.

## Workshop Organization

The workshop organizers are responsible for setting up an online reviewing system, as well as managing the paper submissions and reviews for their respective workshops.  Note that no PCS or similar system will be provided for the workshops.

Workshop organizers will be expected to issue their calls for participation no later than June 19th, 2026 (Friday) and to issue any acceptance decisions to their participants no later than July 17th, 2026 (Friday) to allow sufficient time for travel planning and advance registration to the conference. All camera-ready material for the proceedings should be collected by July 31st, 2026 (Friday).
