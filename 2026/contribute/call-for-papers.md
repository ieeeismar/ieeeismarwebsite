## Overview

ISMAR invites contributions advancing Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), and Virtual Reality (VR). ISMAR 2026 will cover industry and research activities related to the full range of immersive technologies (AR, MR, and VR), including everything from interfaces in the real world to fully immersive experiences, and beyond. This range extends far beyond traditional published work in AR, encompassing precise 3D tracking, visual display, and real-time performance. We specifically invite contributions that advance all aspects of AR / MR / VR technology and user experiences. All submissions must demonstrate an explicit, clear, and significant connection to AR, MR, or VR concepts, systems, or experiences.


## Important Deadlines

This year, there is <strong>a single submission deadline for a unified review process for both IEEE TVCG journal papers and conference-only</strong> papers.
Submissions may be 4-9 pages in length, with an additional 2 pages for references. Note that a <strong>paper abstract must be uploaded</strong> prior to the actual paper submission deadline (see submission deadlines below). All paper submissions must be in English and left blind for review.
All paper submissions must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society VGTC Conference format, as described <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/">here</a>. Please do NOT use the “TVCG journal track” template for TVCG Special Issues.

## Important Deadlines

* Paper submission deadline: March 16th, 2026 (23:59 AoE)
