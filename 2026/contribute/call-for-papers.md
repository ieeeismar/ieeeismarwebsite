## Overview

ISMAR 2026 covers industry and research activities across the full spectrum of immersive technologies, including augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR, MR, and VR). This includes everything from interfaces embedded in the real world to fully immersive virtual experiences, and beyond. The scope extends far beyond traditional AR topics, such as precise 3D tracking, display technologies, and real-time performance. We invite contributions that push the boundaries of AR, MR, and VR technologies and user experiences.


## New This Year

* Paper submissions will not have the option to be directly recommended for poster acceptance.
* All paper submissions must be formatted strictly in accordance with the IEEE Computer Society VGTC conference guidelines.
* A single review cycle with a rebuttal.
* New guidelines are provided for the <strong><a href="#generative-ai">Use of Generative AI</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct.</a></strong>


## Paper Submissions

ISMAR 2026 will follow a unified review process for IEEE TVCG journal and conference papers. There will be only one submission deadline.

The possible outcomes of this unified process are:

1. Accepted as IEEE TVCG journal paper
2. Accept as an IEEE ISMAR 2026 conference paper
3. Reject

Accepted papers will be presented during the conference. Submissions accepted as journal papers will be directly published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Submissions accepted as conference papers will be published in the ISMAR 2026 conference proceedings. All accepted papers will be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library and will be subject to the registration and publication processing policies of ISMAR 2026.

The submission's main body may be 4-9 pages in length. Total length, including references, should not exceed 11 pages. Review papers can request one additional page for references. All paper submissions must be in English and anonymous for the review process. 

All submissions must be made electronically via the <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/ismar26a/" target="_blank">Precision Conference System (PCS) website</a> (opens mid February 2026) and must be strictly formatted according to the IEEE Computer Society VGTC conference style, as described in the <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/" target="_blank">Formatting Guidelines for VGTC Conference Style Papers</a>. Use the <a href="https://github.com/ieeevgtc/vgtc_conference_latex/releases" target="_blank">vgtc_conference_latex</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ieeevgtc/vgtc_conference_word/releases/tag/2024.02.14" target="_blank">vgtc_conference_word</a> template for your submission. Do not use the “TVCG journal track template” for TVCG Special Issues. Papers using the wrong style or template may be desk-rejected.

## Author Guidelines
Author guidelines are available on the ISMAR 2026 website: <a href="/2026/guidelines/paper-guidelines">Paper Guidelines</a>.


## Use of Generative AI {#generative-ai}

In accordance with <a href="https://open.ieee.org/author-guidelines-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-generated-text/" target="_blank">IEEE guidelines</a>, the use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any article submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.

## Review Process {#review-process}

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2026 International Program Committee (IPC): a primary coordinator (1AC) and a secondary coordinator (2AC). 

Submissions that receive low review scores from both coordinators or that violate the submission guidelines will be rejected early. We will strive to have all other submissions receive at least two additional reviews from external reviewers.
At the end of this stage, reviews will be shared with the authors. All authors will be given time to write a rebuttal. Based on the rebuttal, the coordinators and reviewers will make a final recommendation for the paper. This recommendation will be shared with the program chairs and a subset of the IPC, who will then make decisions, with the following possible outcomes:

* Conditionally accepted as IEEE TVCG journal paper. 
* Conditionally accepted as an ISMAR 2026 conference paper.
* Reject.


This decision will be sent to the authors, with the expectation that conditionally accepted papers will incorporate any required changes into the manuscript before the final acceptance of camera-ready versions. The camera-ready version of each accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation to the Program Chairs regarding acceptance. If the acceptance criteria are not met, the paper will be rejected.

Desk rejects are possible at all stages.

## Code of Conduct {#code-of-conduct}

ISMAR 2026 upholds an inclusive, respectful, and supportive community for all participants. We have introduced a new Code of Conduct that defines the professional and ethical standards expected at the conference and in all related activities. By submitting a paper to ISMAR 2026, authors acknowledge and agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. Adherence to these principles is required for participation in the review, publication, and presentation processes. The full <a href="https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> is available on the ISMAR 2026 website.
