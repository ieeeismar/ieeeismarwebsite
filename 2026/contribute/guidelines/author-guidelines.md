This year, there is a single track with a single submission deadline for a unified review process for both the IEEE TVCG journal and conference-only papers. These guidelines cover all papers submitted to the ISMAR 2026 single-track paper program. For more information on the topics of interest and submission deadlines, please see the <a href="https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/call-for-papers/">Call for Papers</a>.

The sections below include details useful throughout the entire submission process, from before submitting the paper all the way through the final publication. Please read this document in its entirety to help prepare submissions for ISMAR 2026.

### Before Submission

Authors should ensure that the paper complies with all <strong><a href="#paper-requirements">Paper Requirements</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#policies">Policies</a></strong>. Authors may optionally submit <strong><a href="#supplemental-materials">Supplemental Materials</a></strong> to provide additional context supporting the submission. Additional information about <a href="/2026/guidelines/writing-good-ismar-paper">writing a good ISMAR paper</a> can be found on the ISMAR website.

### After Submission

For papers to remain under consideration for ISMAR 2026, authors must comply with <strong><a href="#author-requirements">Author Requirements</a></strong>. All submitted papers will follow the <strong><a href="#review-process">Review Process</a></strong>. If accepted, the authors should <strong><a href="#camera-ready-version">prepare the camera-ready version</a></strong> of their paper and an oral <strong><a href="#presentation">Presentation</a></strong> for the conference.

## Paper Requirements {#paper-requirements}

This section specifies the mandatory formatting, submission, and participation requirements for ISMAR 2026. Submissions that do not comply with these requirements may be desk-rejected.

All papers submitted to ISMAR 2026 must:

- Be submitted prior to the deadlines listed in the <a href="https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/call-for-papers/" target="_blank">Call for Papers</a>
- Be related to the ISMAR topics of interest listed in the <a href="https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/call-for-papers/" target="_blank">Call for Papers</a>

## Author Requirements {#author-requirements}

Authors <strong>MUST</strong> participate in ISMAR as described below. Failure to participate may result in the removal of associated submissions from ISMAR 2026.
- <strong>Review Duties for Authors.</strong> A senior author or principal investigator is required to register to review at least three (3) papers through PCS at the time of submission.
- <strong>No Public Promotion of Submission to ISMAR.</strong> Authors may not publicly state, imply, or promote that their work is under submission to ISMAR, including via websites, social media, or press materials, as this violates the double blind review process. Submission to non archival venues such as arXiv or institutional technical reports is permitted, but may compromise anonymity.
- <strong>Conference Registration.</strong> All accepted papers are subject to the ISMAR 2026 registration and publication processing policy published on the conference website. If no author is fully registered by the author registration deadline, the accepted paper will be withdrawn from publication.
- <strong>Code of Conduct.</strong> Authors of accepted papers must comply with the <a href="https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank">ISMAR Code of Conduct</a>
and the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/code-of-conduct" target="_blank">IEEE Code of Conduct</a>.

## Supplemental Materials (Optional)  {#supplemental-materials}
Authors may include supplementary materials with the submission. Supplemental material can include videos, proofs, code, experimental data, appendices, audio files, and other files that supplement the paper. These materials will be included in the conference proceedings and archived in the IEEE Digital Library. A pointer to the supplemental material should be included in the main paper. Supplemental material may not be used to extend page limits; the paper itself must completely describe the research and results.

<strong>Videos.</strong> Authors are encouraged to submit videos to aid the Program Committee and reviewers in reviewing their submissions. Videos should not exceed five minutes. When submitted as supporting material, videos must be free of any identifying information prior to reviewing as per the double-blind submission policy. Authors submitting a video can optionally provide a text description/transcript for accessibility. Videos should be playable with standard software on PCs, Macs, and Linux machines. If the reviewers cannot play the video, it may reduce the chances of the submission being accepted.

## Policies {#policies}

### Ethics and Responsibility

All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines as imposed by your affiliation, and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics commission, if applicable. If no approval was acquired, the reason should be explained in the submission. Approval from any ethical review board must be indicated in the submission system. Submissions must also state whether informed consent from participants was obtained or explain why it was not.

### Use of Generative AI

In accordance with <a href="https://open.ieee.org/author-guidelines-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-generated-text/" target="_blank">IEEE guidelines</a>, the use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any article submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.

### Previously Published or Submitted Work

<strong>Dual/Double Submissions.</strong> Paper submissions must not have been previously published. A manuscript is considered to have been previously published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed or non-reviewed periodical or proceedings that are permanently available in print or electronic form to non-attendees, regardless of the language of that publication. A paper identical or substantially similar in content (in its entirety or in part) to one submitted to ISMAR should not be simultaneously under consideration for another conference or journal during any part of the ISMAR review process, from the submission deadline until notifications of decisions are emailed to authors.

<strong>Authors’ published prior work.</strong> In some cases, a submission may build on the authors’ prior work. To fully explain the relationship between the submitted paper and prior work, authors <strong>must</strong> provide the <strong>anonymized</strong> related publications (including papers, posters, workshops, and work-in-progress publications) as well as an <strong>anonymous</strong> letter of explanation that highlights the significant changes or advances. These documents will only be visible to the 1AC.

<strong>Authors’ prior/related work is currently under review.</strong> In some situations, a submission may be built upon authors’ prior work that is currently under review (e.g., a submission presenting a new data set is under review that the current submission builds upon), or has a contribution closely related to another submission under review (e.g., two submissions presenting the same concept but applied to different use cases). If such prior/related work has not yet been published, authors <strong>must</strong> provide these <strong>anonymized</strong> works, including an <strong>anonymized</strong> letter outlining the relation to the ISMAR submission. This also applies to related submissions being under review at this year’s ISMAR conference. These works should be made available to all reviewers.

### Double-Blind Process and Anonymity Policy

ISMAR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. This means that both the authors and the reviewers are intended to remain anonymous to each other. Submissions (including citations, supplementary material, and optional videos) must not contain information that identifies the authors, their institutions, funding sources, or their places of work. In addition, authors should not publicly promote that the work has been submitted to ISMAR through social media, websites, etc.

However, it is common for authors to publish their work on arXiv, institutional technical reports, and other online venues. Publishing work in these non-archival venues is not prohibited for ISMAR 2026, but it may make it difficult to maintain complete anonymity for submission authors. 

### Plagiarism Check

All submissions will be checked for plagiarism using IEEE Crosscheck. Detection of significant plagiarism will lead to rejection. For more information about definitions of plagiarism and IEEE policies in this area, please see <a href="http://www.ieee.org/documents/opsmanual.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual</a>.

## Preparation of Camera-Ready Version  {#camera-ready-version}

Make final edits based on reviewers' feedback and any other instructions from the paper chairs. Ensure you use the correct formatting and follow any additional instructions provided by the organizing committee. Upload the final version of the paper, along with any supplementary material, to the “Final Submission Form” located at the submission website: <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/ismar26a " target="_blank">https://new.precisionconference.com/ismar26a</a>

## Presentation {#presentation}

All accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference. More details will be provided upon acceptance.
