The IEEE ISMAR 2026 organizing committee invites proposals for tutorials to be held in conjunction with the ISMAR conference. The tutorials will be scheduled on October 5th (Monday) and October 6th (Tuesday) and can be conducted in person, online, or in hybrid mode, in alignment with the ISMAR conference.

The purpose of the tutorials is to expand the knowledge in the fields of Augmented, Mixed, and/or Virtual Reality and to foster the next generation of researchers, developers, and artists. Proposals will be evaluated on their relevance to the conference topics, suitability for presentation in a tutorial format, and the instructors’ qualifications. We will strive for a balance of topics in the tutorial program and also consider the potential for interest and attendance.

The scope of the proposals should be consistent with the <a href=" https://www.ieeeismar.net/2026/call-for-papers/#topics-of-interest">ISMAR 2026 Topics of Interest.</a>

## Important Dates

- Tutorial proposal deadline: **May 22nd, 2026 (23:59 AoE, Friday)**
- Tutorial acceptance notification: **June 5th, 2026 (Friday)**
- Tutorial calls for participation issued by: **June 19th, 2026 (Friday)**

## Format

Experts, pioneers, and experienced developers and artists are needed to propose and present tutorials that may target a specific application area, a specific research area, or a topic of general interest for augmented, mixed, and virtual reality.

Topics can range from introductory for AR/MR/VR novices to highly technical for researchers. Tutorials can be half-day or full-day, depending on the scope of topics covered and the presenters available.
