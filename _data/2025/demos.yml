  title: "Virtual Handshake Enabling Physical Interaction for Remote Presence Augmentation"
  authors: "Sung-Uk Jung, Kyungill Kim, Juyoung Kim, Yeongjae Choi, Sangheon Park, Byunggyu Lee, Daegeun Park"
  abstract: "In this paper, we propose a novel virtual handshake method that provides physical interaction to enhance the sense of presence in eXtended Reality (XR) environments. In XR environments, the limited physical interaction between users often results in reduced presence and immersion. To overcome this, we designed a system that i) provides force and tactile feedback between remote users using XR haptic gloves, and ii) applies users' real-time eye gaze and pose information to avatars to enable natural eye contact during interaction. This research demonstrates the practical integration of real-time physical and visual interaction for remote virtual handshakes in XR environments."

  title: "Demo of SwitchAR: Perceptual Manipulations in Augmented Reality"
  authors: "Jonas Wombacher, Zhipeng Li, Jan Gugenheimer"
  abstract: "Perceptual manipulations (PMs) like redirected walking (RDW) can overcome technological limitations in Virtual Reality (VR). These PMs manipulate users' visual perceptions (e.g. rotational gains), which is currently challenging in Augmented Reality (AR). We propose SwitchAR, a PM for video pass-through AR leveraging change and inattentional blindness to imperceptibly switch between the camera stream of the real environment and a 3D reconstruction. This enables VR redirection techniques in what users still perceive as AR. We present our pipeline consisting of (1) Reconstruction, (2) Switch (AR → VR), (3) PM and (4) Switch (VR → AR), with a prototype implementing this pipeline."

  authors: "Gerlinde Emsenhuber, Michael Smirnov, Tobias Langlotz, Denis Kalkofen, Stefanie Zollmann, Markus Tatzgern"
  abstract: "Optical see-through head-mounted displays require correcting for the camera-to-eye offset whenever virtual cues are derived from camera imagery. We demonstrate two methods that align these cues with the user's view by projecting the processed camera image onto a planar proxy: One keeps this plane at a constant depth, which is sufficient when parallax is small but causes misalignments otherwise, the other uses eye‑tracking to adjust the plane dynamically to the user's fixation, preserving alignment as the user shifts focus. We demonstrate the fixed‑distance version on Microsoft HoloLens 2 and Snap AR Glasses, and the gaze‑driven version on HoloLens 2."

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), such collaborators are now feasible. Yet, fundamental design questions remain: How can we leverage LLMs to support expressive, emergent interactions while managing hallucinations or errors? How can we make such agents feel spatially embedded in the user's environment? To explore these questions, we present Cobot, an embodied AI agent integrated into an Immersive Analytics platform. This paper describes the design and implementation of Cobot, highlighting challenges and opportunities in building embodied, interactive AI collaborators for immersive environments."

  title: "Becoming Mole with FeltSight: Hyper-sensitizing the Surrounding through Mixed Reality Haptic Proximity Gloves"
  authors: "Danlin Huang, Botao Amber Hu, Dong Zhang, Yifei Liu, Takatoshi Yoshida, Rem RunGu Lin"
  abstract: "FeltSight is a mixed reality haptic experience reimagining human perception, inspired by the star-nosed mole. Moving beyond vision-dominated paradigms, it enables meditative wandering guided by extended-range haptics with subtle visual cues. The system comprises a haptic glove paired with an extended reality interface. Reaching toward objects triggers glove vibrations simulating material textures. The mixed reality interface offers reduced reality, presenting nearby objects as dynamic point clouds materializing only in response to exploratory hand gestures. By shifting focus from visual to tactile, FeltSight challenges ocularcentric sensory hierarchies, foregrounding an embodied, relational, and more-than-human mode of sensing."

  title: "Interactive Visualization of Bodily Sensations through AR-based Chakra Representation Using MediaPipe"
  authors: "Soi Choi, Jean Ho Chu"
  abstract: "This paper presents an augmented reality (AR) meditation system that visualizes internal bodily sensations through circular objects mapped to key body joints. Using MediaPipe, the system tracks real-time pose and hand gestures to enable users to modify the size of chakra-like visual elements via pinch gestures, reflecting changes in bodily attention. In parallel, a local large language model (LLM, Ollama) generates meditation prompts independently of user interaction, which are then converted to speech via TTS. This structure creates a layered experience: the body informs the visual interaction, while generative guidance supports sustained inward focus."
