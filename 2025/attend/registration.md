### Author Registration
For each accepted paper published in the proceedings or adjunct proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference with a full (5-day) registration by *<del style="color: lightgrey; font-style: italic;">31 August 2025</del>* **7 September 2025** to present the work at the conference.

- One regular registration (Regular Member / Regular Non-Member) allows publication and presentation of up to **two papers (1+1 policy)**.  
- Author registration must be a **regular registration; student registration will not be accepted** as author registration. Therefore, even if a student is the sole author, regular registration is required.

### The One-Day Pass
The One-Day Pass includes access to all official programs held on the selected day, including workshops, tutorials, and the main conference sessions. If you plan to attend only on **October 8 (Wed.)** or **October 12 (Sun.)** for the workshops or tutorials, you may simply purchase a One-Day Pass for that specific date.

### Member Registration

* **IEEE Member:** To qualify for member registration, you must be an IEEE member. Your membership number is required on the registration page.
* **IEEE Life Member:** To qualify for IEEE Life Member registration, your membership number is required at the registration page.

### Track-Specific Registration Policies

<strong>Video Presentations</strong><br>
Video presentations are treated the same as on-site presentations, and therefore require Regular Registration.

<strong>Doctoral Consortium (DC)</strong><br>
For participants presenting only in the DC track, Student Registration is permitted in line with the purpose of the track.
If a DC participant is also presenting in another track (e.g., Papers, Posters, Demos, or Workshop Papers), a Regular Registration is required.

<strong>Workshop Papers</strong><br>
Since workshop papers are also included in the ISMAR 2025 Adjunct Proceedings, at least one author must complete a Regular Author Registration.
Please select Author → Papers and enter your Workshop Paper ID in the Contribution Number field (as used at the time of final submission).
Example: W-DHXR-1234

<strong>Student Volunteers (SVs)</strong><br>
Please note that Student Volunteer registration waivers do not cover Author Registration.
If a Student Volunteer is also an author of an accepted paper, they must still complete a Regular Registration.

## Invitation Letter

Invitation letters are **issued only** to participants who have completed registration and payment through the official registration system. We kindly request that all participants complete their registration **before requesting an invitation letter**. 
Conference participants are **strongly encouraged** to familiarize themselves with visa requirements **well in advance** of the conference. To ensure a smooth process, we recommend applying for your visa as early as possible. Please note that IEEE ISMAR 2025 is **unable to intervene** with Korean embassies or consulates on behalf of participants.

### Important Note:

Due to a delay in the registration system opening, the issuance of invitation letters is **currently delayed**. The system is expected to open **after mid-August**, and invitation letters will be issued once registration becomes available. In the meantime, **for visa-related emergencies**, we will **exceptionally** issue invitation letters **only to authors** of accepted papers who are not nationals of the host country (the Republic of Korea) and who are facing imminent visa application deadlines. If you urgently require an invitation letter under these conditions, please email [**ieeeismar2025@gmail.com**](mailto:ieeeismar2025@gmail.com) with all of the following information:

 - Full Name
 - Affiliation
 - Nationality
 - Paper Title
 - Paper ID
 - Brief explanation of the urgency (e.g., visa appointment date or submission deadline)

Please note that we may request **supporting documentation** to verify your urgency. Only eligible authors will be considered for early issuance before registration officially opens.
