### K-ETA (Korea Electronic Travel Authorization)

Nationals of countries/regions eligible for visa-free entry are **required to obtain K-ETA approval** to board a flight to the Republic of Korea. K-ETA approval should be applied at least **72 hours prior to boarding** the flight bound. You can apply for the via:
- üåê [K-ETA Website](https://www.k-eta.go.kr/portal/newapply/index.do)
- üì± Mobile App: K-ETA

### Important Notes:

- Foreign visitors who do not require a visa must obtain a K-ETA permit to board a flight bound for Korea.
- Please apply at least 72 hours before departure by accessing the K-ETA website or mobile app (K-ETA) (as assessment can take "more than 72 hours" depending on the situation).
- K-ETA is valid for two years after issuance, and the number of arrivals is irrelevant. However, if the validity period of the passport is within two years when applying for K-ETA, the K-ETA is valid only until the validity period of the passport.
- (K-ETA is not a visa. The issuance of K-ETA does not guarantee the entry of the Republic of Korea, and the entry availability of Korean immigration officials is finally determined according to the results of the immigration inspection.)
