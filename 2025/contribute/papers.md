## Overview

ISMAR 2025 will host **a single track for papers** and include a **revise and resubmit phase** strengthening the rebuttal opportunity.

ISMAR 2025 will cover industry and research activities related to the full range of immersive technologies (AR, MR, and VR), including everything from interfaces in the real world to fully immersive experiences and beyond. This range goes far beyond the traditional published work in AR, such as precise 3D tracking, visual display, and real-time performance. We specifically invite contributions that advance all aspects of AR / MR / VR technology and user experiences.

## Paper Submissions

This year, there is **one submission deadline for a unified review process for both the IEEE TVCG journal and the conference** only papers. The possible outcomes of this unified process are:

1.  Accept as IEEE TVCG paper, with presentation at ISMAR 2025
2.  Accept as IEEE ISMAR 2025 conference paper, with presentation at ISMAR 2025
3.  Recommended as IEEE ISMAR 2025 poster.
4.  Reject

Submissions accepted as journal papers will be directly published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Submissions accepted as conference papers will be published in the conference proceedings of ISMAR 2025. All accepted papers will be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library and will be subject to the registration and publication processing policies of ISMAR 2025.

Submissions may be 4-9 pages with an additional 2 pages of references. Note that a **paper abstract must be uploaded** prior to the actual paper submission deadline (see submission deadlines below). All paper submissions must be in English and **left blind for review**. The accepted papers will also be granted an oral presentation during the conference and will have the opportunity to present as a demo if desired.

## Important Deadlines

- Abstract deadline: **April 4th, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Friday)**
- Paper submission deadline: **April 11th, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Friday)**
- Initial Notification: **June 3rd, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Tuesday)**
- Revise and Resubmit deadline: **June 18th, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Wednesday)**
- Final Notification: <s style="color: #999;">July 22nd, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Tuesday)</s>, July 25th, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Friday)
- Camera-ready version: <s style="color: #999;">July 31st, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Thursday)</s>, August 3rd, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Sunday)


## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles under the single submission deadline.

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial Notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC): a primary coordinator (1AC) and a secondary coordinator (2AC). Submissions that violate the [submission guidelines](/2025/contribute/guidelines/submissions) will be desk rejected. Those submissions that are not desk rejected will receive at least three full reviews by 2AC and two external reviewers.

Based on the reviews and initial discussions among the reviewers and coordinators in consultation with a subset of the IPC, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations for each submission. If a submission is rejected, authors will be able to resubmit to the poster track:

- **Revise and Resubmit.** These submissions will go through the second review cycle, with the authors submitting a revision and rebuttal, as described below. Note that a revise and resubmit recommendation does not guarantee acceptance.
- **Reject.**

### Review Cycle II (Revision with Rebuttal to Final Decision)

Authors will be given time to revise their submissions and write a rebuttal to the initial notifications. The revised submission and rebuttal will be submitted, and the reviewers will review the revised submission. Based on the reviews, the coordinators and reviewers will make a final recommendation for the paper. That recommendation will then be further evaluated by the program chairs and a subset of the IPC. The committee will make decisions about recommendations for the papers in terms of journal, conference, poster track, or rejection.

This decision will be sent to authors with the expectation that minor revisions will be done where required before final acceptance of camera-ready versions. The camera-ready version of each accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator for final acceptance.

## Topics of Interest

All topics relevant to and advancing AR, MR, and VR are of interest. We emphasize that a strong and explicit connection to AR, MR, and/or VR is essential for submissions. VR papers are welcome regardless of their relevance to AR/MR. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Artificial intelligence / Machine learning
- Assistive technologies and applications
- Camera and projector-camera calibration
- Collaborative interfaces
- Computer vision
- Content creation/authoring and content management
- Conversational and speech interfaces
- Display technologies (e.g., eyewear, smartwatches, projectors)
- Diversity and inclusivity issues
- Ethical issues
- Ergonomics and human factors
- Free viewpoint image generation
- Haptic and tactile interfaces, wearable haptics, passive haptics, pseudo haptics
- Human augmentations
- Human-computer interaction
- Immersive visual analytics
- Localization, spatial registration, and tracking
- Locomotion and navigation techniques
- Mediated and diminished reality
- Multimodal input and output
- Omnidirectional, 360, immersive videos
- Optics
- Perception
- Presence, body ownership, and agency
- Psychology
- Real-time performance issues
- Rendering techniques
- Sensor fusion
- Spatial audio, auditory perception, and psychoacoustics
- Spatial AR, projection mapping, projector-camera systems
- System architectures, distributed, and online systems
- Touch, tangible, and gesture interfaces
- Technology acceptance and social implications
- Teleoperation, telepresence, and telexistence
- User experience, usability studies, and human-subjects experiments
- VR simulations of AR/MR
- Virtual production
- Virtual humans and avatars
- Visualization techniques
- AR/MR/VR applications from domains include, but are not limited to:
  - Architecture
  - Art, cultural heritage, education and training
  - Automotive and aerospace
  - Entertainment, sports broadcast
  - Health, wellbeing, and medical applications
  - Industrial, military, emergency response
  - Therapy and rehabilitation
