## Call for "Pitch Your Lab"

We invite research groups from all areas of XR (Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality), 3D User Interfaces, and related fields to apply to present in the "Pitch Your Lab" session at the IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality 2025 (ISMAR 2025).

Presentations may highlight the group's research areas, team members, facilities, ongoing and past projects, academic and industrial collaborations, and open opportunities. Both academic and industrial labs are welcome to participate.

Accepted submissions require at least one presenter to attend the conference and deliver the oral presentation in the "Pitch Your Lab" session at ISMAR 2025. While presentation materials will not appear in the official proceedings, a list of participating labs and their contact details will be featured on the ISMAR 2025 website, providing visibility to the broader XR community.
