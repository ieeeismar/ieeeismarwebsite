## Poster Presentation Guidelines


This year, posters will be presented **only on-site**. If you cannot
attend in person, only your fast-forward poster video will be displayed
at the conference venue. **There will be no dedicated online poster
session.**

In summary, the poster presentation is organised as follows:

**On-site poster presenters**

-   Preparation
    -   Hardcopy poster
    -   Fast-forward poster video

-   Presentation
    -   Poster presentation at the conference venue during poster sessions
    -   Poster video playback at the conference venue

**Non-attending poster presenters**

-   Preparation
    -   Fast-forward poster video

-   Presentation
    -   Poster video playback at the conference venue

**Note: If you do not attend ISMAR 2025 <u>AND</u> at least one
of your co-authors covers your poster with their registration, your
poster paper will appear in the adjunct proceedings.**

## Required Material for Poster Presentation

We ask **<u>ON-SITE</u>** poster presenters to prepare the
following material:

-   **A hardcopy poster (A1 size, single-sided, portrait, color)**
-   There is **no specific template** required for the poster, but we ask the authors to put the following information:
    -   Paper title
    -   Author name(s) and affiliation(s)
    -   One or several pictures describing your idea
    -   Some text to present the main contributions and the achieved results
    -   Think about your poster as a support material to discuss with participants
    -   Avoid lengthy text paragraphs and try to be clear and concise
-   **You need to print and bring your poster to the conference venue. ISMAR does not have a printing service and has no recommendations for local printing services.**

We ask **<u>ALL</u>** poster presenters to prepare the following
material:

-   **A fast-forward poster video (maximum 30 seconds, English subtitled)**
-   There is **no specific template** required for the fast-forward poster video, but it should (at least) contain the paper title, author name(s), and affiliation(s). The video should promote your poster, allowing the audience to get an overview of your work.
-   The recommended video format is **MP4** with **a resolution of 1080p** **(fit to the 16:9 aspect ratio of a display)**.
-   **You need to submit your video file via the Google Form below. The video file size must not exceed 100 MB.**

## How to Provide Your Material

All materials need to be submitted via the following **Google Form by
