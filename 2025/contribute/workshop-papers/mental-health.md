## Overview

<img src="{{ 'assets/2025/img/post/mental-health-overview.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Mental Health Overview" class="post-right-float-img">

Mental health conditions pose a major challenge to healthcare providers and society at large. The World Health Organization predicts that by the year 2030, mental health conditions will be the leading disease burden globally. Mental health services are struggling to meet the needs of users and arguably fail to reach large proportions of those in need. Early intervention, support and education can have significant positive impact on a person's prognosis. 

Augmented, Virtual and/or Mixed Reality environments can create new effective models in the wider context of prevention and support for individuals affected by mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, addictive behaviours and substance abuse disorders. 

Following our successful ISMAR 2019 (China), ISMAR 2021 (Italy), ISMAR 2022 (Singapore), ISMAR 2023 (Australia) and ISMAR 2024 (USA) workshops on the same topic as well as a special issues we recently organised at Virtual Reality journal, the goal of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for Extended Reality researchers and Health researchers and practitioners to submit their original ideas, work-in-progress contribution, and position papers on the design and/or evaluation of new mental health technologies. We are interested in theoretically, empirically, and/or methodologically oriented contributions focused on supporting mental health delivered through novel designs and evaluations of on AR/VR/MR systems. In addition to potential benefits, we would also like to receive contributions on potential dangers of using such technologies for addressing mental health issues.
