## Workshop Date
**October 12th (Sunday)**

## About the Workshop
This workshop aims to share the current state of research in Mixed Reality (MR) and Robotics in Korea and Australia, and to explore ways to collaborate between the two countries. The main areas of focus are the current research trends in MR and Robotics in both countries and ways to connect academia and industry. Through this, we expect a synergistic effect on the research and industrialization of MR and Robotics in both Korea and Australia.

## Call for Participation
We are pleased to announce a joint workshop between Korea and Australia focusing on fostering collaboration in the fields of Mixed Reality (MR) and Robotics. This workshop will be held in conjunction with the International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR) 2025 in Korea. 
This workshop is supported by the Tech-Bridge program of the Korea Research Foundation and the GCF(Global Connections Fund) of Austrailian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. It aims to bring together researchers and industry professionals from both Korea and Australia to:

  - Share the latest research trends and advancements in MR and Robotics in each country.
  - Explore potential avenues for collaboration between Korean and Australian research institutions and industries.
  - Discuss strategies for strengthening the connection between academia and industry in both nations.

The primary focus areas of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
  - Current research status and future directions in MR technologies. 
  - Recent developments and applications in MR and Robotics. 
  - Opportunities for joint research projects and initiatives. 
  - Collaboration models between universities, research institutes, and companies. 
- Synergistic possibilities for the research and industrialization of MR and Robotics in Korea and Australia.

We invite researchers, engineers, industry representatives, and students from both Korea and Australia who are actively involved or interested in Mixed Reality and Robotics to participate in this exciting workshop. This is a valuable opportunity to network, exchange ideas, and forge potential partnerships for future collaborations.
