## Overview

The ISMAR demonstration track features contributors showing working prototypes, technologies, and designed experiences to engage with the ISMAR attendees. Your demonstration can take the shape of a live interactive demo, a lab or corporate exhibition, an interactive art exploration, or any combination of these.

All accepted demonstrations will be presented at the conference, and presentations will be in person during the scheduled Demo Session(s). All submissions will include pre-recorded videos which must include (if applicable) takes from an egocentric viewpoint, so attendees can experience how your demo works from the userâ€™s perspective. Submitters are asked to provide a 2-page description of their demonstration, which will be available on the conference website.

We encourage a diverse range of demonstrations on the topic of Virtual, Mixed, and Augmented Reality. You are free to demonstrate the work presented in the papers, posters, or workshop sessions, as well as any new visionary, engaging, or emerging project not yet presented elsewhere!

The main selection criteria will be the expected general interest of the demonstration to the Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality community.
