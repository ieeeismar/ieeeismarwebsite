## Call for Mentors – ISMAR2025 Doctoral Consortium

Hello Professors and Professionals,

We are pleased to announce that **10 doctoral students** have been selected to participate in the upcoming Doctoral Consortium, to be held on **Wednesday, October 8**, as a half-day workshop. You can view their papers at the link provided below.

We are seeking mentors who can attend and provide constructive feedback on the students’ presentations. Each student will have 30 minutes for their talk, including Q&A. Mentors are welcome to attend only part of the session — full attendance is not required.

Your expertise and guidance will be invaluable in helping shape the next generation of scholars. If you are available and willing to serve as a mentor, please contact us via the emails below.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to contribute.
