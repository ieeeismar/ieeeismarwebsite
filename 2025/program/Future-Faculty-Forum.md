## Future Faculty Forum (F3)

**Want to become an XR faculty member OR level up your existing academic career? Join us on Wednesday, October 8,2025, for the Future Faculty Forum (F3) at IEEE ISMAR!**

We are excited to host the fifth meeting of the XR Future Faculty Forum.
This Forum aims to foster a vibrant community of scholars and educators
eager to collaborate, learn, and advance together toward or in an
academic career in the XR field. At its heart, Forum meetings are a
venue where colleagues can reconnect and collaboratively develop future
generations of academic researchers. Forum meetings will be a means to
introduce students who are interested in or curious about an academic
career to professorship. Additionally, early-career faculty can hear
from seasoned professors about how to improve or expand their research
programs.

You can expect the following at F3 meetings:

1.  **Engaging Sessions:** Delve into thought-provoking presentations and discussions led by distinguished experts at the forefront of XR in academia.

2.  **Mentorship and Networking:** Connect with experienced faculty, postdocs, and senior graduate students who have successfully integrated their interests into academic careers. Build meaningful connections, seek guidance, and explore potential collaboration opportunities.

3.  **Professional Development:** Acquire valuable insights and resources for career development in academia. Gain guidance on navigating the academic job market, establishing your research profile, and cultivating a successful academic career that embraces XR technologies.

F3 has been a part of each IEEE ISMAR and IEEE VR conference since ISMAR 2023. We will continue to convene at future ISMAR and VR conferences and are looking for ways to expand beyond conference happenings.

The ISMAR 2025 F3 meeting will take place for a full day on **Wednesday,
October 8.**

### Overview & Goals {#overview--goals}

This forum meeting is designed to foster mentorship, education, and collaboration among students curious about eventually becoming AR/VR (or XR) faculty.

The meeting of the Future Faculty Forum at ISMAR 2025 will feature
**panels and tutorials** with current professors about various aspects
of professorship such as tenure, creating and organizing a research
program, teaching, and professional service, and more generally what
aspects of their profession they like and dislike, and why. We will
attempt to include professors (on the panels) who have also worked in
industry and therefore have some basis for comparison. Additionally, the
forum will include **"speed advising" sessions** in which students will
be able to have several short advising sessions with current faculty. In
this portion, students will have the opportunity to ask more specific
questions about a particular professor\'s experience while learning from
a breadth of experiences. While brief, these meetings will help form
relationships between students, junior faculty, and professors, and
participants can continue their conversations later in the forum and
conference. The panels and speed advising sessions will feature diverse
faculty to provide students with various perspectives on the meaning of,
success within, and preparation for professorship. Throughout the forum,
there will be an emphasis on creating and sustaining an academic
environment that is diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible.

### Forum Format {#forum-format}

The XR Future Faculty Forum meeting will be in-person and will consist
of interactive tutorials, multiple panels with group discussions, and
1-on-1 mentoring sessions.

The interactive tutorials will go into detail about successfully
preparing professor application materials and the interview process. For
instance, we will go over an ideal CV and discuss the importance of a
cover letter. We will also see examples of research, teaching, and
diversity statements, and critique them as a group. Further, the
tutorials will introduce F3 attendees to details about the professor job
cycle, e.g., when the job cycle opens, how long it lasts, and how to
read calls for professor positions. We will also cover what happens once
the application is submitted, e.g., what to expect at a virtual
interview, and how to prepare for an in-person interview. Finally, we
will cover aspects of negotiating a job offer.

Each panel will be centered on a specific aspect related to being a
professor (e.g. a panel on how to manage a research lab, a panel on
dealing with the challenges of interdisciplinary research). For each
panel, we will have a brief introduction of the panel members and the
panel topic, and then move into questions and group discussions. We will
have prepared some starter questions to get the discussion going, after
which we will open the floor to questions and comments from the forum
attendees. We will recruit professors with the appropriate background to
speak on the panel topic (e.g. the panel on differences in universities
will include faculty from a range of institutions and countries to best
represent the different perspectives on this topic).

We will also host a "speed advising" session to facilitate more
personalised discussions. In this session, attendees will be paired with
a professor for 15 minutes for a 1-on-1 conversation. This conversation
allows aspiring professors to get advice regarding their specific
situations and questions, unlike the more general advice from panel
sessions. After each 15-minute session, attendees will be rotated out so
that more people can get the chance to speak to a professor.

### Forum Schedule {#call-for-participation}

-   **Tutorials**
