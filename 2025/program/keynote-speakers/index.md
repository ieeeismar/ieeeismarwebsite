### **Title:** A Journey to AI x XR: What is the best device for the multi-modal AI era?

#### Abstract

In the era of multi-modal Artificial Intelligence (AI), the convergence of AI and eXtended Reality (XR) is revolutionizing immersive technologies. In this talk, I will review the technical challenges in the XR industry over the last decade, and show how we have overcome those by exploring the pivotal role of on-device AI, multi-modal AI and computer vision in advancing XR experiences, especially on various XR form-factors including Project Moohan - the first device utilizing a new AndroidXR platform, an initiative bridging AI and XR to redefine user-centric real-world XR applications. 
The talk will underscore how multi-modal AI integrates diverse data streams—visual, spatial, and contextual—to create seamless, intelligent, and immersive XR experiences while synergies between software and hardware innovations are also emphasized. Attendees will gain insights into Samsung’s vision for next-generation devices and the transformative potential of these technologies across various industries.

### **Title:** Distributed AI: The Future of Connected Intelligence

#### Abstract

We are witnessing the dawn of Distributed AI, where intelligence is no longer confined to centralized clouds but extends to the edge of networks. Edge AI now encompasses Physical AI that interacts with the real world and Agentic AI that acts autonomously, bringing intelligence closer to people, devices, and environments. Concurrently, Cloud AI provides the scale, coordination, and learning capacity necessary to connect these edge systems. This keynote will highlight how the rise of Distributed AI signals the beginning of a new era—one in which intelligence emerges through the interplay of Edge and Cloud, with connectivity as the key enabler of progress.
