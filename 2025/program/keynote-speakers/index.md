### **Title:** Beyond Words: Beyond Reality [CALIVERSE]'s Vision for the Metaverse

#### Abstract

CALIVERSE is a next-generation AI metaverse platform that seamlessly combines immersive shopping, live performances, gaming, and Web3 user-generated content into a unified virtual experience.

Built on cutting-edge technologies such as Unreal Engine 5, AI-powered lighting, VR AI enhancement, real time live-action rendering integration, and 3D AI conversion, CALIVERSE delivers an incredibly lifelike virtual world.

The platform supports multiple environments, including PC, VR HMD, and glasses-free 3D displays (Screen Protector), delivering high-fidelity 4K+ virtual experiences with premium quality and deep immersion.

In particular, CALIVERSE seamlessly composites live-action footage with real-time rendered graphics and utilizes AI lighting and image enhancement technologies to deliver natural and visually coherent virtual performances.

It can depict audiences of over 80,000, setting it apart from conventional metaverse platforms designed for younger users.

By integrating Korea’s advanced server networking technology, CALIVERSE enables massively scaled simultaneous connections, setting a new standard for ultra-immersive next generation metaverse platforms.

### Speaker Biography

Dongkyu Kim began his career at NC SOFT, a leading South Korean game developer, marking his entry into the gaming industry. He then spent over a decade at SEGA, one of Japan’s most renowned game companies, where he served on the Korean board and developed deep expertise in global game development and operations.

With a strong vision for immersive technology, Mr. Kim founded VISION VR, specializing in next-generation VR content. Leveraging proprietary interaction patents, the company created premium experiences—such as interactive cinema and virtual concerts— for major platforms including KT, LG U+, and SONY PlayStation, earning industry acclaim. In 2021, following a strategic merger with Lotte Data Communication, the company was rebranded as CALIVERSE. Under Mr. Kim’s leadership, CALIVERSE has focused on building a highly immersive metaverse platform that blends real-world fidelity with creative interactivity.

CALIVERSE enables users to evolve from consumers to creators through a content-driven ecosystem where individuals can produce, share, and monetize their work. The platform combines live-action graphics with virtual environments, supports stereoscopic 3D content via proprietary film technology, and is compatible with a wide range of devices—bridging the digital and physical worlds.

Rooted in Web 3.0 principles, CALIVERSE is redefining the metaverse experience through superior content quality, accessibility, and device integration.

The platform has been featured at major global events including CES (2022–2025) and GDC 2025, as well as key regional showcases such as Metaverse Expo 2023 and Korea Blockchain Week 2023, drawing attention for its unmatched immersion and technological excellence.
